- We continue the code we had from Chapter 4 and build upon it. I have added a copy of the starter code from Chapter 4 in folder called "starter_code".
- need to go into views/header and views/scripts and prefix the route for js and css with a "/". lastly we need to do the same in create.ejs, change "assets/img/contact-bg.jpg" to "/assets/img/contact-bg.jpg".
- app.use(express.urlencoded()); is deprecated, we should add { extended: true } as an arg to urlencoded, ie. app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
